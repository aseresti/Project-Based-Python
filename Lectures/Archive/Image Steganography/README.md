# Image Steganography
> DIFFICULTY: **INTERMEDIATE**

**Image Steganography** is hiding information within images such that it deceives the viewer as if there is no hidden information within the image. With the help of this, two people can communicate secretly.

This is an interesting project in which we will be given two options: encode and decode. By clicking the encode button secret message, the name of the file should be entered and uploaded. After uploading the file the image will be encoded. By clicking the decode button upload the file that is to be decoded and after uploading the hidden text will be displayed on the screen.

The objective of this Python project is to hide the message within the image and then decode the image. It uses **Tkinter**, **Stegano** modules.

## Modules

- tkinter: It is the Graphical user interface package.
- tkinter.filedialog : This module offers a set of classes and functions that can be used to work with files.
- stegano: Itâ€™s the python steganography module.
- messagebox: It is used to display the message boxes.

## TODO

1. Installation of Tkinter and Stegano modules
2. Importing modules
3. Initializing the screen
4. Function to decode the image
5. Function to encode the image
