# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is an interactive console-based game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" implemented in Python. This project is structured to provide students with practical experience in Python programming, debugging, and code structuring.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll be building a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where two players can play. The game will be developed with Python and played through the terminal.

## Project Structure
```
.
├── game.py                     # Main python script to run the game
└── README.md                   # Project description and instructions
```

## Instructions

1. Run the `game.py` script from your terminal to start the game.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding and Implementing the game's logic in Python.
- Use of control structures (loops, conditional statements).
- Use of functions and Python built-in functions.
- Input/output handling.

## Hints

- Break down the problem into smaller tasks for easy implementation.
- Make use of functions for tasks that need to be implemented multiple times.

## Conclusion

This project provides a great way to enhance your Python skills working on a fun and interactive project. Feel free to extend the game with more features and functionality. Good luck and happy coding!
