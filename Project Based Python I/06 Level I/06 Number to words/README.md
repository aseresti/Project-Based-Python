# Number to word
> DIFFICULTY: **EASY**

This Python project idea converts an integer number provided via user input to its equivalent words. This program is set up to support numbers with a maximum of 12 digits, but feel free to modify the program to handle larger numbers (hint: requires conditional statements and loops).

As an easy-to-understand example of basic Python projects, this simple but effective program can expand your skills with loops, user input, and conditional statements, not to mention Python tuples and lists.

## TODO

1. Use conditional statements and loops to specify the order of each digit.
2. Convert the number into words.

## RULES

- The maximum input number can be 12 digits
- You should not use any module.

## Test
input:
**1587455256**

output:
**One Billion Five Hundred Eighty Seven Million Four Hundred Fifty Five Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Six**
