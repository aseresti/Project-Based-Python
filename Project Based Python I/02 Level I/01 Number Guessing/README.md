# Number Guessing
> DIFFICULTY: **EASY**

This beginner Python project is a fun game that generates a random number (in a certain range) that the user must guess after receiving hints. For each wrong guess the user makes, they receive extra hints, but at the cost of reducing their final score.

This program is a great way to experiment with the Python standard library, as it uses the Python **random** module to generate random numbers. You can also get some hands-on practice with conditional statements, print formatting, and user-defined functions.

## TODO

1. Import random module.
2. Generate a random number in a certain range
3. Ask the user to enter his guess.
4. Check if the input number is within the range or not. If not, display a message.
5. If the user guess is wrong, show an extra hint.
6. Continue showing hint until the guess number becomes true.
7. Ask the user if he wants to play again or not.
