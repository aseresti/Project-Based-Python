# Tic Tac Toe
> DIFFICULTY: **INTERMEDIATE**

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that involves a nine-square grid. Each player alternately marks their space with an O or an X, and whichever player manages to mark three Os or Xs diagonally, horizontally, or vertically wins. Each player must also block their opponent while attempting to make their chain.

This is one of the most fun Python projects that uses **object-oriented programming** to create a new class called **TicTacToe**. Use this to represent the game's features via the class attributes and methods.

This program also uses the Python **random** module to select a random player to start the game.

## TODO

1. Import modules you need
2. Create TicTacToa class
3. Add board attribute to class object
4. Create an empty board
5. Use random module to select the first player
6. Get row and column from player to fill the board with an O or an X
7. Swap the player turn and continue the game
8. Check if the board is filled or not.
9. Check rows, columns and diagonals to detect the winner
10. Check if the game is over or not
