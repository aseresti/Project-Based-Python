# Rock Paper Scissors
> DIFFICULTY: **EASY**

This Rock Paper Scissors program simulates the universally popular game with functions and conditional statements. 

As one of many Python coding projects that imports additional libraries, this program uses the standard libraryâ€™s **random**, **os**, and **re** modules.

## TODO

1. Import required libraries.
2. Asks the user to make the first move by passing in a character to represent rock, paper, or scissors.
3. Evaluate the input string with re module.
4. Use random module for computer turn.
5. Use conditional logic for checking the winner.
6. Show winner and clean the terminal with os modules.

## Rules

- rock blunts scissors so rock wins
- scissors cut the paper so scissors win
- paper cover rock so paper wins
