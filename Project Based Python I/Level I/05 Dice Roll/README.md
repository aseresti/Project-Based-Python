# Dice Roll
> DIFFICULTY: **EASY**

As one of the most relatable Python projects for beginners with code, this program simulates rolling one or two dice. It’s also a great way to solidify your understanding of user-defined functions, loops, and conditional statements.

As one of the Python easy projects, it’s a fairly simple program that uses the Python **random** module to replicate the random nature of rolling dice. You’ll also notice that we use the **os** module to clear the screen after you’ve rolled the dice.

## TODO

1. Ask the number of dice from user.
2. check the user input is an integer or not.
3. Riase an error if the user input is not integer.
4. Use random module to generate the rolling dice number/numbers.
5. Ask user if he wants to play again. If yes, clear the screen.
